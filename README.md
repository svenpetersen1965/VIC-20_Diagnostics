The Diagnostic Cartridge is based on the design for the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/Commodore-VIC-20-Super-Expander-II">VIC-20 Super Expander II</a> design.

Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/VIC-20-Hyper-Expander">Hyper Expander</a> Cartridge can be used as a Diagnostic cartridge, too. All RAM (except the BLK5 8K block) can be installed for the Diagnostic.
